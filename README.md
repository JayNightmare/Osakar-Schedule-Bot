## Have a bug?
Submit an `Issue` and tell me what's wrong.

## Things to note before cloning
This codebase is uses discord.js, sqlite3, .env, and a few other packages. If you experience a problem with a package, don't blame me. Do `npm install` to install all dependencies from package.json.

### How to use
1. "How do I get my Channel ID for YouTube?"
- Go to your settings -> advanced settings -> channel id.

2. "I went live but the notification isn't appearing?"
- The bot is on a 15 minute interval. This is because of API limiations as too many calls and the whole thing will freeze.

3. "How do I get my Playlist ID for YouTube?"
- Click on your playlist to view the list of videos in your playlist. From here, go to the URL and you'll see `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=numbers`. Copy the numbers from `list=` and paste it into the `playlistid` value.

4. "How do I put my video into the playlist?"
- Get the url of the video you want to add/remove from the playlist and enter it into the value.
